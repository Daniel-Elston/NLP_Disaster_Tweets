# Raw Data

This directory contains the raw data for the project.

The raw data has been split into three parts:

1. `raw_training_data.csv`: This is the original raw training data.
2. `training_data.csv`: This is the training data after splitting the original raw training data. It is used to train the model.
3. `validation_data.csv`: This is the validation data after splitting the original raw training data. It is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Note: The raw testing data (`raw_testing_data.csv`) is used as it is for final model testing, as it does not contain any true labels.
