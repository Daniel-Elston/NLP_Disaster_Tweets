# GloVe

GloVe pre-trained word vectors have been used to produce vector representations of words for this project. Specifically:
`Twitter (2B tweets, 27B tokens, 1.2M vocab, uncased, 25d, 50d, 100d, & 200d vectors, 1.42 GB download):Â [glove.twitter.27B.zip](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.twitter.27B.zip)`

For the sake of computational resources, a 25 dimensional vector representation has been applied. Please see the link below for `.zip` downloads and further documentation.
