<h1 align='center'> NLP Disaster Tweets </h1>

<hr>

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying whether a given tweet pertains to an actual disaster event or not.

The goal is to demonstrate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text classification tasks, and how NLP can benefit the real world.

#### -- Project Status: [Complete]

## Project Intro/Objective

This project uses a dataset from a Kaggle competition, which includes original tweets and labels indicating whether they are about a real disaster or not. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict this label, given a new tweet.

The challenge lies in handling the unstructured and noisy nature of social media text data, and training a model that can effectively capture the underlying signals that indicate a disaster event. Various data preprocessing techniques are used, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization. Machine learning techniques, such as LightGBM are used to build the predictive models.

## Methods Used

* Data Visualization
* Data Preprocessing
* Natural Language Processing
* Machine Learning
* Pipeline Formulation
* YAML Configuration Files
* Word Embedding

## Technologies

* Python 3.11
* GloVe (word embeddings)
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Gensim, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, XGBoost
